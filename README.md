# Web Scraping : Books to Scrape

This project scrapes book information from the [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/) website using Python.  
It demonstrates  my skills in **web scraping, data cleaning, and exploratory analysis**.

## What I Did
- Scraped book details: **Title, Price, Availability, and Rating**.  
- Cleaned and structured the data into a Pandas DataFrame.  
- Exported the data to **CSV** for easy use.  
- Performed simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Requests & BeautifulSoup (web scraping)  
- Pandas (data handling)  
- Matplotlib (visualizations)  

## Output
- `books.csv` → Clean dataset of scraped books.  
- `Books_to_scrape.ipynb` → Jupyter/Colab notebook with scraping and analysis code.
